# <img src="https://img.icons8.com/nolan/54/overview-pages-2.png"/>Long Story Short:-
Flying Dutchman is designed to reflect all analytical data captured by Kalypso. Portal is able to collect data from rest API services and returns data as per the filtration process by the user. This portal provides a glanced view of all of the available devices, it also provides the detailed view of all the devices in graphical as well as tabular format. On the other hand, we have a very efficient admin panel where we can add device, add new user and monitor their activity closely. This way the web portal brings user and admin under the same roof.

Proposed Solution can be a Game-Changer to Assure Success of In-Land Fishing battling the odds of Climate Change:
 - Meets Dual Mandates of Proactive Tracking & Automated Correction :- Promotes movement from reactive waterbody controls to proactive tracking and monitoring to detect water parameter anomalies early and take necessary corrective actions (Fresh water pumping, pH correction, Natural nutrients supply etc.)
 - Launchpad of an Emerging Product :- Comes with a solid roadmap for productization with inclusion of additional features such as Predictive Analytics, Integration with Govt. authorities, Water Quality Management toolchain etc.
 - Novel Technology Coupled with Scalability :- Prototyping done considering recent technology trends in cloud, mobility and IoT for offering an economically viable solution to the less-privileged communities
 - Promotes Digital Inclusion & Community Building :- Intends to reach out to every fishing community at the furthest corners with inherent scalability â€“ enabling inclusive technology and community building
